# Determine if they like to code.
- Looking for evidence they code outside of work.
- Look for a desire to learn new things. Software engineering is about learning new stuff every year. 
- Software engineers who like to code and build stuff need very little management and oversight.
- We can’t afford to hire software engineers who don’t like to code.

# Determine if they can code. 
- Have them write code in any language they like.
- Review their code online.
- Ask them to describe how their coding has evolved over time. Any good programer gets better at coding the longer they do it. If they can’t describe how their coding and tooling has evolved then this indicates we should not hire them. 
- Anyone who can code can pickup a new language syntax within the course of an interview.
- Assign them a simple coding exercise during the interview or after-hours (pay them). 
- It does not matter if they don’t know our technology stack if they like to code and learn new stuff they will quickly learn our technology stack.
- I don’t bother asking them to solve hard coding problems as most of our coding is simple CRUD code. 

# Determine if they would be happy coding with our technology stack.
- Our technology is modern but not bleeding edge on purpose so we don’t bleed.
- Our technology model matches our business model.
- We strive to generate nearly identical code by following the same coding standards. Your code looks like mine and mine like yours. 
- We solve problems nearly identically.
- There is plenty of room in our technology stack to add or change things, but it is a group discussion and decision lasting months.

# Determine if they would fit our office and work culture.
I have no advice on this and general leave this to others to determine.
